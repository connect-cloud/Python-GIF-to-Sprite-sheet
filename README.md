# Python GIF to Sprite Sheet
 A Python script to convert an animated GIF image into a sprite sheet using Pillow. The outpuf file is ready to be used on an OLED Display (Monochrome of Color) with CircuitPython.
 
 In CircuitPython you are going to need the adafruit_imageload library to load and display the sprite sheet as an animated icon. Video is coming.
